Done Brightness Control of LED using LDR sensor deployed on STM32F412 nucleo board leading to an energy efficient system

# Getting Started

1. For Running the files just copy below following files to Keil in your PC:

  ON_OFF_LED.txt

  Brightness_Control_LDR.txt

  Adaptive_Brightness_Potentiometer.txt

2. Then run these files after connecting STM32F412 board to your PC.

3. Setup configuration is given in in CircuitDiagram.png . Just follow the connections and you will able to run the files.

4. For any explanation just read Detailed_Documentation.pdf file.
